    "    <p><strong>NumPy Array (ndarray):</strong> A NumPy array, or <em>ndarray</em> (short for \"n-dimensional array\"), is a fundamental data structure provided by the NumPy library in Python. It is a powerful data structure that allows you to store and manipulate large datasets efficiently. NumPy arrays have several key characteristics:</p>\n"

    "        <li><strong>Homogeneous Data Type:</strong> All elements within a NumPy array must have the same data type, such as integers, floats, or other numerical types. This homogeneity ensures consistent data representation and efficient computation.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Multi-Dimensionality:</strong> NumPy arrays can have multiple dimensions. This makes them suitable for representing and working with data of varying shapes, including vectors (1D arrays), matrices (2D arrays), and higher-dimensional data structures.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Efficient Memory Handling:</strong> NumPy arrays are memory-efficient and provide optimized storage, which reduces memory overhead. This efficiency is essential for handling large datasets.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Vectorized Operations:</strong> NumPy allows you to perform operations on entire arrays, eliminating the need for explicit loops. This concept, called \"vectorization,\" leads to concise and efficient code for numerical computations.</li>\n",

    "        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> NumPy arrays are highly memory-efficient and faster to process than standard Python lists for numerical operations. They are implemented in C and allow for efficient memory handling.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Vectorization:</strong> NumPy enables you to perform element-wise operations on entire arrays, eliminating the need for explicit loops. This results in more readable and efficient code.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Broadcasting:</strong> NumPy provides a mechanism called \"broadcasting\" that allows you to perform operations on arrays with different shapes. It automatically aligns smaller arrays with larger ones, making operations more flexible.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Multi-Dimensional Support:</strong> NumPy arrays support multi-dimensional data, making them suitable for various applications, including linear algebra, image processing, and scientific simulations.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Mathematical Functions:</strong> NumPy offers an extensive library of mathematical and statistical functions, enabling advanced numerical computations, such as matrix operations, Fourier transforms, and statistical analysis.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> NumPy seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries commonly used in data science, such as pandas for data manipulation, SciPy for scientific computing, and Matplotlib for data visualization.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> NumPy allows you to manage memory manually when necessary, offering fine-grained control over data storage and retrieval.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> NumPy is cross-platform and works on various operating systems, making it suitable for both development and deployment across different environments.</li>\n",
